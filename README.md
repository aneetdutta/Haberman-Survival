# Haberman-Survival
Explotary Data analysis of Haberman Survival dataset.  The objective of this work is to select the best feature using univariate and multivariate analysis techniques for better classification accuracy.

Dataset description:
  The dataset contains 3 Features and 2 classes.
  
  The 3 features are:
  
    1. Year_operation: The year in which the person was operated. 
    2. Age_operation: The age of the person when he/she was operated.
    3. Axillary_nodes: Number of positive axillary nodes detected.
  
  The 2 classes are:
  
    1. Survived 5years or more from the date of operation.
    2. Died within 5years from the date of operation.
  

The univariate analysis technique used are:

  1. Probabilty Density Function(PDF).
  2. Cumilative Density Function(CDF).
  3. Box Plot
  
The Bivariate analysis technique used are:
  1. Pair Plot.
 
 Conclusion:

"Axillary_node" is the best feature among all the 3 features which will give maximum accuracy in classification decided on the analysis based on Box plot technique.
